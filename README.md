# Citelink

*Cite Link Changer* (`citelink`) is a simple command-line tool that takes academic papers and turns the bibliography citation links into direct web links to the referenced paper. Since academic papers can be packed with outside references, this can speed up background reading tremendously.

## Usage

To convert a PDF, navigate to its directory in your terminal and run the following command:

```sh
citelink
```
This will take the most recently modified PDF in the working directory and convert all citation links in the PDF that point to the bibliography into URLs that take you straight to the paper (Google search `â†’` click first link).

If you want to convert a different PDF in the working directory, say `mypaper.pdf`, you can pass in a PDF name as an argument:

```sh
citelink mypaper.pdf
```

Enjoy!
